What does it do?
- For every audio file you have in your smartphone (all supported audio types by Android and jAudioTagger library), it will generate an audio fingerprint, then will connect to an ACR server and will download the correct data for every song, later will allow you to correct the song with this downloaded information; in other words, it will make a Shazam-like recognition but not from audio recorded, but over audio files you have and will correct their meta tags, including filename.

For what?
- The objective of this app is to correct meta tags from your audio files to help you maintain your musical library more organized.

What does it offer?
- Automatic, semiautomatic and manual correction for your audio files.
- It will be totally free(if license of ACR service allows me), open source and ad free.

What corrects?
- Automatic, semi automatic and manual mode allows to correct title, artist, album, genre, track number, publication track year, cover art and filename (it will apply the same name of title, if is ON on Settings app).
- Download cover mode only corrects the cover art.

- Automatic and manual updating of list, in case songs are added or removed from your smartphone.
- The correction made, including cover art, is made over the file itself, means that changes are visible to every media player able to read ID3 tags(most nowadays).
- For MP3 files, in any mode of correction, ID3 tags version 1 will be automatically converted to ID3 version 2, this conversion will allow to write covers over the file itself(and other tags) to mp3 files, because ID3 version 1 has not support for some tags.
- Background correction (with notification in status bar indicating the progress of task an ability to stop it from here) no matter if you close the app.
- Crashlytics to report back to developer issues and crashes.
