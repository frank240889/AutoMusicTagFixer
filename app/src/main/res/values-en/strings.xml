    <string-array name="answers">
        <item>Of each song that you have in your smartphone, an audio fingerprint is generated, later, that fingerprint is consulted in a database and the corresponding information is obtained for the fingerprint more similar found.</item>
        <item>Because the songs are stored in the memory (internal or SD) of your smartphone, it is needed the permission to reading them; is the only permission required, otherwise, the app will not have useful functionality.</item>
        <item>Due to Android security restrictions, you can not modify the SD files without explicit permission to do so; This permission only applies if your smartphone has an SD slot and an SD memory card is inserted. You can enable or disable it from the {gmd-settings} Configuration {gmd-arrow-forward} {gmd-build} General.</item>
        <item>Just click a song from the list and the semiautomatic mode will open, or if you prefer, you can check the ones you want to correct by touching the {gmd-check-box} of each one and then press {gmd-photo-filter} in the lower right corner on the main screen to correct those songs in automatic mode.</item>
        <item>It is the mode in which you check the songs you want to correct, press {gmd-photo-filter} on the main screen, and AutoMusicTagFixer corrects for you each song, including the file name (you can disable this option in {gmd-settings} Configuration), you do not have to do anything, just wait for it to finish. This mode does not require your intervention, you can even close the app.</item>
        <item>It is the mode that obtains the information of the song, but it will not modify it until you apply it.</item>
        <item>It is the mode that allows you to correct by yourself the tags of each song, including the cover art, if you have the information at hand. Click the cover of each song in the list on the main screen for more options.</item>
        <item>Currently Mp3, Mp4 (Mp4 audio, M4a and M4p audio) Ogg Vorbis, Flac, Wma and limited support for Wav and Real audio. Some songs will not be able to be read since Android does not support certain types of audio in a native way, for example Wma; in future updates the support will be expanded.</item>
        <item>None.</item>
        <item>Because the app uses a license for free use of the audio recognition service, the number of daily songs that you can correct in semiautomatic, automatic and download-cover modes is variable, from a few tens to thousands.</item>
        <item>For performance and speed of opening, to generate the list for the first time (the list is informative and starting point for operations), AutoMusicTagFixer reads the information of each audio file of the MediaStore (an internal BD of Android), so therefore, the information obtained here is not always very accurate. AutoMusicTagFixer when it shows the detailed information of each song, directly reads the audio file, which this information read it is accurate; do not worry, AutoMusicTagFixer makes the corrections on the file itself, so the changes made will be visible to other audio players, whether Android or not, and that support the reading of tags.</item>
        <item>They are more than 35 standard tags, a considerable amount and that can be tedious for the user to correct, so correction is offered to the most common.</item>
        <item>It may be because you did not grant access permission to internal/external storage or the audio type is not one supported by Android natively or the file does not have an extension in the name. Also, if it\'s the first time you copy songs to your smartphone you have to wait a few minutes for Android to update the MediaStore.</item>
        <item>The app consults a database with information of approximately 200 million songs (http://www.gracenote.com/music/music-recognition/), so it is likely that the song you are trying to correct has been downloaded/converted from a low quality audio source and the generated fingerprint does not match any of the database, please try to download/convert your songs with higher quality or correct it manually.</item>
        <item>Check the options of {gmd-settings} Configuration {gmd-arrow-forward} {gmd-data-usage} Data usage and select another cover size; keep in mind that not all sizes are available for each song.</item>
        <item>If the connection to the network is good, it will take between 5 to 10 seconds; if the connection is slow, it may take longer, and even the current identification may be canceled if the internet connection is lost.</item>
        <item>Song correction can work in the background for automatic mode (you can disable this option in {gmd-settings} Configuration), and so the correction will continue until it finishes or you stop it. If this option is disabled, the correction process will be cancelled when you close the app. For other modes, the correction will be interrupted if you close the application.</item>
        <item>AutoMusicTagFixer checks the status of the network and the internet connection, so if it does not detect an active connection to the internet, it will not work the automatic, semiautomatic and download-cover mode; if a correction is in progress the correction will simply stop. Manual mode does not require internet.</item>
